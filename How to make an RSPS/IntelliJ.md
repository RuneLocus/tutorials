# Hosting an RSPS: IntelliJ
In this part we'll be using IntelliJ to set up our RSPS project. The free edition of IntelliJ (IntelliJ Community Edition) is more than enough for RSPS. You can download it [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download). The paid version gives more integrations with frameworks and other tools which you don't need.

## Creating the project structure
In the welcome screen of IntelliJ which is presented when no project is open, click on "New Project".

I prefer creating a new project because it lets you create a structure similar to how you would make it in Eclipse.

Once you clicked on it, you'll see a project window appear:
